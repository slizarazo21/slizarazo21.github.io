### Impact of environmental conditions on airborne disease progression
##### Lizarazo, Simon. Zhou, Aijia. 

Small droplet nuclei can stay in air over hours without disturbance like ventilation. Pathogen loaded particles can easily build up in closed spaces after being produced by infected people, especially in poorly ventilated conditions. Thus, superspreading events can happen in indoor environments, such as the ones observed during the ongoing SARS-COV-2 pandemic. The likelihood of infection for airborne-diseases is different between indoor and outdoor environments. In this paper, we developed an SIR model to understand the dynamics in transmission for an airborne disease by combining both indoor and outdoor transmission. We evaluated how the proportion of individualsâ€™ groups changed as a function of movement frequency, indoor environmental conditions, and time. The results obtained highlighted the importance and impact of indoor conditions throughout the transmission of airborne diseases
