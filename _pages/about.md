Hello! Welcome to my website, I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Molecular and Integrative Physiology and Master student in Applied Statistics at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://mcb.illinois.edu/) in the school of Molecular and Cellular Biology. My Ph.D. work intersects genomics, statistics, data science and neurobiology. I am co-advised by [Dr. Kevin Van-Bortle](https://www.vanbortlelab.com/) and [Dr. Nien-Pei Tsai](https://nptsai.web.illinois.edu/wp/).

I am originally from Colombia where I obtained a degree in Pharmacy at Universidad Nacional de Colombia [(National University of Colombia )](https://ciencias.bogota.unal.edu.co/areasCurriculares/farmacia/inicio). Also, I was a visiting student during the last semester of my undergrad at Purdue University. I am curious by nature and an avid learner!

Feel free to navigate through my website, you can explore the different projects I have worked on during my Ph.D. and also small projects I have done throughout my masters degree in Statistics.
